    @section intro_sec Introduction

    LOOT is a utility that helps users avoid serious conflicts between their mods by setting their plugins in an optimal load order. It also provides tens of thousands of plugin-specific messages, including usage notes, requirements, incompatibilities, bug warnings and installation mistake notifications, and thousands of Bash Tag suggestions.

    This metadata that LOOT supplies is stored in its masterlist, which is maintained by the LOOT team using information provided by mod authors and users. Users can also add to and modify the metadata used by LOOT through the use of userlist files. The LOOT API provides a way for third-party developers to access this metadata for use in their own programs.

    All further API documentation is contained within the documentation for api.h.
