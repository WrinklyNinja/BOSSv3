/**
    @file api.h
    @brief This file contains the API frontend.

    @note The BOSS API is *not* thread safe. Thread safety is a goal, but one that has not yet been achieved. Bear this in mind if using it in a multi-threaded client.

    @section var_sec Variable Types

    The BOSS API uses character strings and integers for information input/output.
      - All strings are null-terminated byte character strings encoded in UTF-8.
      - All codes are unsigned integers at least 16 bits in size.
      - All array sizes are unsigned integers at least 16 bits in size.
      - File paths are case-sensitive if and only if the underlying file system is case-sensitive.

    @section memory_sec Memory Management

    The BOSS API manages the memory of strings and arrays it returns internally, so such strings and arrays should not be deallocated by the client.

    Data returned by a function lasts until a function is called which returns data of the same type (eg. a string is stored until the client calls another function which returns a string, an integer array lasts until another integer array is returned, etc.).

    All allocated memory is freed when boss_destroy_db() is called, except the string allocated by boss_get_error_message(), which must be freed by calling boss_cleanup().
